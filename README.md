DriveVision AI
Welcome to DriveVision AI, an innovative driving technology designed to enhance safety, convenience, and visibility for drivers through advanced AI and augmented reality (AR) features. This project integrates a suite of cutting-edge tools, including an LLM-powered chatbot, AR windscreen displays, and AI-driven vision enhancement systems.

Overview
DriveVision AI redefines the driving experience by combining artificial intelligence with automotive technology. Key features include:

LLM Chatbot Assistance: A language model-powered chatbot that assists drivers by referencing car manuals to troubleshoot issues and provide repair guidance. In the future, it will also adjust car settings dynamically based on user preferences or conditions.
AR Windscreen HUD: An augmented reality windscreen that displays heads-up display (HUD) elements such as road navigation, real-time restaurant reviews based on the driverâ€™s line of sight, and critical driving information.
AI-Powered Vision Enhancement: An intelligent rain and fog removal system that enhances road visibility by processing and clarifying the view displayed on the windscreen.
Trajectory Detection & Warnings: Real-time detection of pedestrians and vehicles, with AR overlays (e.g., circling objects on the windscreen) to alert drivers of potential hazards.
This project aims to make driving safer, more intuitive, and enjoyable by leveraging AI and AR technologies.
